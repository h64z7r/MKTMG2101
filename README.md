CRITERIA FOR GRADE DETERMINATION 
Class Attendance and Participation Policies 
Mandatory Attendance: Class attendance   is   required. Accumulated   unexcused absences will   result   in   a   lower grade and   may   lead to   being dropped from the course.   Prior   notification   is   required for absences, except   in emergencies.
Active Participation: Participation   is essential. Students are expected to contribute to   class   discussions and activities   by sharing their viewpoints, comments,   and   questions.
Engagement in Classroom Experiments: Active   participation   in classroom experiments   is crucial for   generating valuable   insights and   making the activities   meaningful.
Weekly Quizzes: Quizzes will   be administered weekly   at the   end   of   class,   based   on   reading   assignments and topics covered during the   sessions.
Evaluation Principles for Assignments:
Attractiveness and Evaluative Model: Assignments and   projects will   be assessed   using the
S.U.C.C.E.S.S. framework   (Heath    Heath, 2007). This framework, which will   be thoroughly explained   in class,   is designed to enhance the   memorability,   appeal,   and   persuasive   impact   of your   ideas.
Timeliness and Integrity: Assignments   must   be submitted on time   according to the   deadlines   set   by   the   instructor.   Plagiarism, fabrication,   unauthorized   use of artificial   intelligence technologies,
outsourcing assignments to third   parties, or any other   form   of   dishonesty   is   prohibited   [see   section   8   for   more   information].
Individual Assignments / Projects: 
Students will   regularly complete   individual assignments   provided   by the   instructor. These can   be
submitted either at the end of the   class   or   at   the   beginning   of the   next   class.   Individual   assignments      include writing short essays, analyzing case   studies,   and   creating   mind   maps   on the topics   and   issues   discussed during   lectures.   Paying attention to the   lecture   is crucial for success.
Group-assignments: 
Group activities   include   laboratory   projects, case-study analyses, oral   presentations, computer   simulations,   post-project evaluations, field experiments and group-study assignments.
Examinations: 
Details, expectations, and formats will   be   provided   prior to the examination.   Exams   may   include   a   mix of open-ended questionnaire,   brief essay   prompts, and   case   study   analyses.   The   purpose   of
these examinations   is to assess your command of the   material   covered   in   a   particular   unit   (through   short-answer questions) and your ability to synthesize   concepts   into   an   evidence-based   argument         (through the essay   prompts).
Grade Appeal: 
Students and faculty at Temple   University   have the   right to a fair   adjudication   of grievances
concerning academic   matters. Students are encouraged to   discuss   any grading   issues   with   their
instructor or   relevant   Program Coordinator first.   If the student and   instructor   cannot   come   to   a
mutually agreeable   resolution,   more   information about the academic grievance   process   is   available at:   https://www.tuj.ac.jp/policies/academic-grievance.
